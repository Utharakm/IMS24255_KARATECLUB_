KARATE CLUB COMMUNITY DETECTION

WHAT IS THIS? This is a Python project for my Graph Theory class.

It analyses a famous dataset called "Zachary's Karate Club"—a social network of 34 members of a karate club that fell apart because of a conflict between the Instructor (Mr Hi) and the Officer.
My code uses an algorithm to automatically detect "communities" (groups of friends) within the club to see if we can mathematically predict how the club is split up.
FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY

Karate_Club_Modularity.ipynb: The main notebook file. This contains all the Python code, the graphs, and my analysis.
README.md: This file explains the project.

WHAT YOU WILL SEE
Network Graphs: Visualisations showing the club splitting into smaller and smaller groups.
Charts: Line graphs showing how the "centrality" (popularity/importance) of the members changes as the groups split.
Discussion: A short explanation of why Mr Hi and the Officer remain the most important nodes.

LIBRARIES USED
networkx (for graph math)
numpy & scipy (for calculations)
matplotlib (for plotting the pictures)
